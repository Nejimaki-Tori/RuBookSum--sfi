    abstract = "The majority of existing text summarization datasets include short-form source documents that lack long-range causal and temporal dependencies, and often contain strong layout and stylistic biases. While relevant, such datasets will offer limited challenges for future text summarization systems. We address these issues by introducing BOOKSUM, a collection of datasets for long-form narrative summarization. Our dataset covers documents from the literature domain, such as novels, plays and stories, and includes highly abstractive, human written summaries on three levels of granularity of increasing difficulty: paragraph-, chapter-, and book-level. The domain and structure of our dataset poses a unique set of challenges for summarization systems, which include: processing very long documents, non-trivial causal and temporal dependencies, and rich discourse structures. To facilitate future work, we trained and evaluated multiple extractive and abstractive summarization models as baselines for our dataset."

    abstract = "In recent years, research in text summarization has mainly focused on the news domain, where texts are typically short and have strong layout features. The task of full-book summarization presents additional challenges which are hard to tackle with current resources, due to their limited size and availability in English only. To overcome these limitations, we present ``Echoes from Alexandria'', or in shortened form, ``Echoes'', a large resource for multilingual book summarization. Echoes featuresthree novel datasets: i) Echo-Wiki, for multilingual book summarization, ii) Echo-XSum, for extremely-compressive multilingual book summarization, and iii) Echo-FairySum, for extractive book summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Echoes {--} with its thousands of books and summaries {--} is the largest resource, and the first to be multilingual, featuring 5 languages and 25 language pairs. In addition to Echoes, we also introduce a new extractive-then-abstractive baseline, and, supported by our experimental results and manual analysis of the summaries generated, we argue that this baseline is more suitable for book summarization than purely-abstractive approaches. We release our resource and software at \url{https://github.com/Babelscape/echoes-from-alexandria} in the hope of fostering innovative research in multilingual booksummarization."

Recent work shows that planning can be a useful intermediate step to render conditional generation less opaque and more grounded. We present a web browser-based demonstration for query-focused summarization that uses a sequence of question-answer pairs, as a blueprint plan for guiding text generation (i.e., what to say and in what order). We illustrate how users may interact with the generated text and associated plan visualizations, e.g., by editing and modifying the plan in order to improve or control the generated output.A short video demonstrating our system is available at \url{https://goo.gle/text-blueprint-demo}"

Despite accelerating LLM adoption in sensitive-information environments, the lack of disclosed training data hinders replication and makes these achievements exclusive to specific models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose: &lt;/strong&gt;Given the multilingual nature of the latest iteration of open-source LLMs, the benefits of training language-specific LLMs diminish, leaving computational efficiency as the sole guaranteed advantage of this computationally-expensive procedure. This work aims to address the language-adaptation limitations posed by restricted access to high-quality instruction-tuning data, offering a more cost-effective pipeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method: &lt;/strong&gt;To tackle language-adaptation challenges, we introduce Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP), a novel method with lower training data requirements and minimal disruption of existing LLM knowledge. LEP employs an innovative embedding propagation technique, bypassing the need for instruction-tuning and directly integrating new language knowledge into any instruct-tuned LLM variant. Additionally, we developed Darumeru, a new benchmark for evaluating text generation robustness during training, specifically tailored for Russian adaptation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results: &lt;/strong&gt;We applied the LEP method to adapt LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B for Russian, testing four different vocabulary adaptation scenarios. Evaluation demonstrates that LEP achieves competitive performance levels, comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct. Further improvements were observed through self-calibration and additional instruction-tuning steps, enhancing task-solving capabilities beyond the original models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/strong&gt;LEP offers a viable and efficient alternative to traditional language-specific instruction-tuning, significantly reducing the costs associated with language adaptation while maintaining or surpassing the performance benchmarks set by contemporary LLMs.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={4}, journal={Journal of Language and Education}, author={Tikhomirov, Mikhail and Chernyshov, Daniil}, year={2024}, month={Dec.}, pages={130-145} }
